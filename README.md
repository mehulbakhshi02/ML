The codes were developed while taking the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course on Coursera by DeepLearning.AI and while learning ensemble methods from Ensemble Methods for Machine Learning by Gautam Kunapuli. The codes were the part of a programming assignment.

1. Logistic regression: Logistic regression classifier to recognize cats.
2. 2_Layer_NN: 2 layer ANN for planar data classification (output classification image attached).
